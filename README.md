# YOLO Architecture Reasoning: From v1 to Modern Variants

## Motivation
Why understanding architectural decisions in object detection matters.

## Problem Statement
What question this project tries to answer.

## Background: YOLO v1
High-level overview of YOLO v1 and its design philosophy.

## Key Architectural Decisions in YOLO
Why YOLO uses grid-based prediction, convolutional layers, and unified detection.

## Evolution Beyond YOLO v1
How and why later YOLO versions modified the original design.

## Tradeoffs and Design Reasoning
Accuracy vs speed, localization vs classification, simplicity vs flexibility.

## What I Would Explore With More Compute
Concrete next steps if given larger compute resources.

## Reflections
What I learned and how my understanding evolved.
