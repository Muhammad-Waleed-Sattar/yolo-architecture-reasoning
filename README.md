Analytical comparison of YOLO architectures with emphasis on design decisions and tradeoffs.

# YOLO Architecture Analysis

## Overview

This project presents a comparative analysis of YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection architectures, from YOLOv1 to the latest YOLOv8. The goal is to understand **why each layer is designed and placed the way it is**, and how the architecture has evolved over time to improve accuracy, speed, and multi-scale object detection.

The project emphasizes:

- Independent analysis of architectural decisions
- Layer-by-layer reasoning: **"Why this layer?"** and **"How does it work?"**
- Simulation-based observations using publicly available datasets
- Visualization of performance metrics and design tradeoffs
